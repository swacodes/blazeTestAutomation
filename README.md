This is an automation using Selenium Webdriver using Java
This work needs improvement on the following lines:
 1. Better Exception Handling
 2. Adding Extent Reports/Allure Reports instead of relying on the TestNG Reports
 3. Adding more test scenarios
 4. Adding the test data from a different source instead of hard coding
 5. Usage of explicit wait 
 6. Execution on the Jenkins
